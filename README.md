# Mapping_Earthquakes

This Module asked us to map earthquakes that occurred over the last 7 day, paying close attention to the most massive.  This map has been prepared multiple ways so the viewer may see the information in a format that is the most pleasing.  The map will show the fault lines that course throughout the world, and the viewer can see the relationship of earthquakes to the proximity of the fault line.  Or, the viewer can choose to hide the fault lines if they so wish.
